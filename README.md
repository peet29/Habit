In this app user can chose what they like and app will tell what habit they have.
I use nav drawer as a menu to chose a category and then show a list of choice in fragment after user chose it will open a new activity to show what habit they have and can share to there friends.
	All data are store in JSON file. First time app launch it will get data in JSON and put in content provider after that it will never open JSON file again.
